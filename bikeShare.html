        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        </div>
        <p>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_sharing_system">Bike sharing systems</a> have gained popularity
            over the past decade. Because of their accessibility and affordability,
            more than 500 bike sharing programs are running around the world to provide a low-cost alternative for
            short-term commutes and to help alleviate traffic. As bike sharing demands increase, unavailability and uneven
            distribution of bikes become a critical issue for the programs, which could undermine usersâ€™ experience and
            waste public resources.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;
            This project implemented a dashboard using Javascript D3 library to provide interaction with the
            Bikeshare demand data, provided by Capital Bikeshare, the bikeshare service in Washington D.C.
            One of the most important goal of this project is to visualize the bike rental demands geographically and
            to understand how they vary overtime.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;
            The result of this project can serve as part of city mobility research and provides insights of how to
            make bikeshare service better and benefit more people's daily life.

        <h2 class="page-header">BikeShare Data</h2>
        <p>
        This project worked on two bikeshare datasets. The first one is trip history data, hosted by
        <a href="https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/">Capital Bikeshare</a>, where each row contains <b>starting station,
        ending station, starting time, ending time and duration</b> of a trip.<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;The second one is the aggregated bike demand data by hour along with the extraneous variables such as
        <b>temperature, wind speed, and humidity</b>. It is hosted
        by <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset">UCI ML repository</a>.<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;Subject to the limited storage space provided by web service, I partitioned the data by months
        and only use the data in November 2012.<br>
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6">
        <h2 class="page-header">Data Preparation</h2>
        <p>
        To calculate hourly demands for each station, I first aggregated data by hours and stations to calculate how
        many bikes come and leave. Then, minus number of leaving with number of coming to obtain the hourly demands.
        In addition, to be able to plot them on the map, I merge the latitude and longitude into the data. Finally,
        I merged my aggregated dataset with the UCI dataset to incorporate the extraneous variables.

    <h4><b>Calendar and Clock</b>:</h4>
        They are filters. <b>Click them</b> to select different part of
        data.
    <h4><b>Symbol Map</b></h4>
        I encoded the locations and bike demands of each
        station in the circles and use contrasting color to distinguish the supply and demand. Green stands for
        the excess of supplies while red stands for the excess of demands. In addition, I encoded intensity in
        the opacity of colors. So, the stronger the color is, the more excess the value is.<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;
        The interactivity of this map includes a tooltip that displays the name of a bike station and its bike demand at
        certain time stamp. To access more detail about certain stations, we can <b>click the circles</b> and the
        line chart would show their demand distribution over 24 hours.

    <h4><b>Two Sided barchart</b></h4>

        This visualization aims to provide <b>bike demand information by region</b>. I decide to implement it using
        vertical two-sided bar chart, which allows users to easily
        compare values of different regions with the least lie factor involved.<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;
        For the interactivity, <b>hover bars</b> to see the exact bike demands and their location.

    <h4><b>Line Chart</b></h4>
        The purpose of this visualization is to realize the distribution of bike rental demand
        and also allow users to make easy comparison between two selected stops.<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;
        For the interactivity, I implemented <b>tooltip cursors</b> for each time series. To display it,
        <b>hover the mouse in plotting region</b>.

            <h2 class="page-header">Challenge</h2>
            <p>
            The biggest challenge of this project is to perform simultaneous transition of symbol map, bar chart,
            and line chart when the calendar or the clock is clicked. I addressed this challenge with function objects and
            sets of associated object methods. For instance, for each of them, I define one function object to initiate
            the plot, one object method to update the underlying data attached with svg elements and another object method
            to manipulate the transition. Once each function object is instantiated, I can easily handle the transition by
            simply calling their object methods.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;
            In addition, number of station with observed records varies from day to day. For Nov. 1st, there might be 95 stations
            while for Nov. 2nd, there might be only 90 stations. To dynamically track which stations have records on a given
            date, I assigned a key function of station name in <i>data()</i>. It would authomatically subset my dataset into
            <b>enter, exit, and update</b>. With separated accesses of this three subsets, I can create
            new circles for <b>enter</b> data, update the color scale and opacity for <b>update</b> data, and remove the
            circles of <b>exit</b> data.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
        Generally, we can classify each station into either a more downtown neighborhood such
        as zip code <b>20004, 20005, 20006, 20007, 20245, 20415, 20433, and 20546</b> and a more residential
        area like <b>20001, 20002, 20003, 20008, 20009, 20010, 20011</b>. Stations within the residential regions
        have huge demand during <b>7am to 9am in weekdays</b>, the time when people leave for works or schools. This
        demand not surprisingly delays to 10am to 12pm in weekends.<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;
        Conversely, stations within the downtown area suffer a huge bike in-flood every morning. This
        uneven distribution would reverse in the afternoon when people start to leave their school or office.<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;
        Consequence of this uneven distribution problem might be lack of decks when people try to return
        bikes or might be lack of bikes when people actually need ones. Either way could be very frustrating and
        ruins user experience. Hence, I think with the solid understanding of bike demand distribution of each station
        the bikeshare service can develop a redistribution program to move those bikes around in rush hours
        and alleviate this problem.
